    <h1>Just Stuff I Want to Say</h1>
    <p>
        It is annoying how the assignment itself is worded. The assignment states:
    </p>
    <p>
        "We advise you not to use it as a check-off list while you are doing your project, so you can use your creativity. Instead, use it as a 
        check-list after you have completed the project. We will be grading strictly on aesthetics, if you use the rubric as a check-list 
        we will be able to tell because students that do that don't tend to put a lot of effort into the physical look of their website."
    </p>    
    <p>
        That itself is a misleading because while it might be "graded" strictly on aesthetics, the rubric where all the points are shown, shows 
        that the points come from getting  comes from everything else it seems. If it is graded aesthetically then it becomes an opinionated idea 
        of what the good website design looks like. To me I like how most of it looks, only issue for me is the fact we had to use bootstrap because 
        it is far more confusing than writing our own html and css code to try and add things in without messing up for hours on end.
    </p>

        Just had to get that out there.
